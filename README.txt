This game is controlled using the WASD keys as well as enter, escape and R. WASD is
used to navigate the menu and move the player in the game scene. Enter is used to
select the currently selected option when a player is in the menu, escape is used to
return to the main menu from the game scene and R is used to restart the game when
the player dies. Game can be fully exited at any time by simply returning to the 
main menu screen and selecting "exit".
